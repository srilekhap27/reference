Hi Team,

I'm starting work on the JIRA ticket for integrating the On-Prem Retrieval Service with the MyDocs Content API to confirm document ownership. I have a few quick questions:

DynamoDB Query: What specific identifiers (document ID, user ID, etc.) will be used for the GET request to confirm ownership?
Error Handling: Should all failures return the same generic error message, or do we need specific messages for different scenarios (e.g., document not found vs. service failure)?
Logging: Are there any specific logging standards or tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Splunk) to follow for error handling?
Testing Edge Cases: Any special cases we should consider, like handling large documents or high traffic?
Thanks for your help!
